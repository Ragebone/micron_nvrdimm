# Micron NVDIMM

A very nice person send me one of those Micron NVDIMM-N orrather NVRDIMM sticks to have some fun with. 
It looks and feels like a regular RDimm with dual rank, 9 modules each and a central buffer chip as usual for RDimms. 
Unusual is the added flash, controller and periferal stuff to make it working. 

It is a MTA18ASF2G72PF12G6V2XAB  16GB  2666mHz module that landed in a Supermicro x10dri (-f) for testing with
Memtest86 V8.2 Free that detected it as NVDIMM but suprisingly with no error checking.


pending Testresults.
